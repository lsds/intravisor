To compile, run "make", but also see the file config.mk for more details on the
various options that can be compiled in.

Where possible use the Makefiles to compile. This is particularly relevant for
the client libraries as symbol information will be included.  Use cmake to
compile on Windows or Mac.

If you have any questions, problems or suggestions (particularly related to
installing on a more unusual device) then please get in touch using the details
in README.md.
